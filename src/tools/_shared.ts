 * (`ofw_get_message`) marks an inbox message read on OFW as a side effect,
 * populating `fetchedBodyAt` and the recipient's `viewedAt` but leaving the
 * stale `read: false` behind.
 *
 * The derivation is monotonic — every input can only turn read ON — so a later
 * resync (which re-scrapes the list flags) can never flip a read message back
 * to unread:
 *
 *  - INBOX: the account holder is the recipient. When we know our own id
 *    (`selfUserId`), that recipient's `viewedAt` is authoritative; otherwise any
 *    recipient's `viewedAt` stands in (1:1 co-parent messaging). Fetching the
 *    body marks the message read on OFW, so a non-null `fetchedBodyAt` is also
 *    read=true. The stale scrape flag is only a last-resort fallback.
 *  - SENT: "read" means a *recipient* has opened it — tracked via their
 *    `viewedAt` (the detail endpoint's real timestamp) — never our own body
 *    fetch, which is always set for sent messages.

 *  - Worse, on draft updates OFW returns the same success shape even

 *    the write landed (callers compare detail.body to args.body).
 *
 * Both responses are validated STRICT against `detailSchema` / the POST
 * schema (this is the write-verification boundary — issue #83); `ctx`
 * names the calling tool in the error message.
 *
 * Returns a discriminated union so callers can narrow with
 * `if (result.id !== null)`. When id is null (no id field in the
 * response — never observed in production, but defensive), `raw`
 * carries the POST response so the caller can still surface it.
 *
 * The generic is parametrized on the schema's OUTPUT type `T`
 * (`detailSchema: z.ZodType<T>`, `detail: T`) rather than on the schema
 * type itself. This mirrors `parseLenient`'s own signature
 * (`<T>(schema: ZodType<T>, …): T`) exactly, so `T` is inferred straight
 * from the schema and flows into the return type with no `as` cast — the
 * compiler verifies that `detail` matches `detailSchema`'s output. (A
 * `<S extends z.ZodType>` constraint would widen the output to `unknown`
 * and force a cast at this call site.)
